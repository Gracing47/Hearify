# Hearify Phase 3: Neural Immersion & Polish 💎

This document tracks the transition from Phase 2 (Native Foundation) to Phase 3 (Immersive Experience & Polish).

---

## 🎨 A. Visual Fidelity & Immersion (The "Wow" Factor)

* [x] **Neural Canvas Core:** **Stabilized**
* [x] **The Singularity (Bloom):** **Implemented**
* [x] **Organic Animations (Physics):** **Implemented**
* [x] **Semantic Zoom (LOD):** **Done**
* [x] **Synapse Runtime 2.0:** **DEPLOYED** ✨
    * *Details:* EWMA Focus Stabilizer, Raptor Physics Engine, McKinsey Clarity culling

## 🧹 B. UI/UX Polish (Removal of Friction)

* [x] **Trinity Navigation:** **Fixed & Fluid**
* [x] **Decluttering:** **Done**

## 🚀 C. PHASE 4: THE EXPANSION (The "Connection" Feel)

1.  **MCP Host Implementation**: Bring external knowledge (Notion, GitHub, Slack) as native graph nodes.
2.  **AI Auto-Clustering**: The system automatically generates summary-labels for large node groups.
3.  **Cross-Modal Drift**: Not just voice, but your calendar and current location shift the Horizon's focus area.
4.  **Daily Delta**: High-speed reflection recap generated every morning from previous data.
