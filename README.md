# 🧠 Hearify — Neural Architecture for Thought

Hearify is a next-generation "Neural Architecture" that captures, vectorizes, and spatially organizes your thoughts into a living, breathing universe.

## 🌌 The Trinity Interface
Hearify replaces standard tab navigation with a physics-based "Trinity" interface:
*   **Orbit (Input)**: The central presence. Voice-first capturing of facts, feelings, and goals with an interruptible, human-like neural loop.
*   **Horizon (Context)**: A 3D spatial canvas where nodes cluster semantically in real-time.
*   **Chronicle (Archive)**: A bento-grid chronicle of your personal history and "Daily Deltas".

## 🚀 Intelligence Layer
*   **Conversational Awareness**: Hearify maintains short-term dialogue context (Rolling Window) alongside long-term semantic memory.
*   **Temporal Intelligence**: The neural loop is aware of "Live Time", allowing Hearify to relate thoughts to the user's current moment in history.
*   **Hybrid Reasoning**: Dual-path processing via **Groq (Fast Path)** for instant banter and **DeepSeek R1 (Reasoning Path)** for deep insights.
*   **Native Vector Search**: Industrial-grade `sqlite-vec` integration for <5ms semantic retrieval.

## 🏆 Current Features
- **Interruptible AI**: Stop the AI mid-sentence with a tap to pivot or refine thoughts (Dynamic Interaction).
- **Semantic Deduplication**: Intelligent merging of similar ideas to keep the "Neural Horizon" clean.
- **Neural Glass UI**: High-fidelity SKSL shaders with refraction and organic distortion.
- **Write-Time Pathfinding**: Automatic edge calculation for instant spatial visualization.

## 🛠️ Getting Started
1. **Install Dependencies**: `npm install`
2. **Setup Env**: Configure your API keys in the app settings or via `.env`.
3. **Run**: `npx expo start`
