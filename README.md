# 🧠 Hearify — Neural Architecture for Thought

Hearify is a next-generation "Neural Architecture" that captures, vectorizes, and spatially organizes your thoughts into a living, breathing universe.

## 🌌 The Trinity Interface
Hearify replaces standard tab navigation with a physics-based "Trinity" interface:
*   **Orbit (Input)**: The central presence. Voice-first capturing of facts, feelings, and goals.
*   **Horizon (Context)**: A 3D spatial canvas where nodes cluster semantically in real-time.
*   **Chronicle (Archive)**: A bento-grid chronicle of your personal history.

## 🚀 Tech Stack
*   **Core**: React Native + Expo (SDK 52+ / New Architecture)
*   **Graphics**: @shopify/react-native-skia (High-performance shaders)
*   **Intelligence**: DeepSeek R1 (Reasoning), OpenAI (Embeddings), Groq (Transcription)
*   **Database**: op-sqlite + sqlite-vec (Native JSI vector search)
*   **Animation**: React Native Reanimated 3

## 🛠️ Getting Started
1. **Install Dependencies**: `npm install`
2. **Setup Env**: Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add your API keys.
3. **Run**: `npx expo start`

## 🏆 Features
- **Write-Time Pathfinding**: Semantic connections are pre-calculated for instant canvas loading.
- **Neural Glass UI**: A premium obsidian/glass aesthetic with smooth micro-animations.
- **Community Detection**: Automated Louvain clustering of thoughts into topics.
- **Multimodal AI**: Integrated reasoning and TTS for a conversational experience.
