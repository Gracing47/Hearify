This is a significant strategic evolution. By centering the README around the **Goals, Feelings, and Facts (GFF)** framework, we are moving the project from a "feature list" to a "methodological standard."

In McKinsey terms, we are moving from *Operational Excellence* to *Strategic Differentiation*. In Notion terms, we are moving from *Blocks* to *Contextual Systems*.

Here is your rewritten README, optimized for clarity, hierarchy, and the GFF core.

# 🧠 Hearify — The Neural OS for Thought

**Hearify** is a next-generation "Neural Architecture" that transforms fragmented cognition into a structured, spatial universe. Unlike traditional note-taking apps that act as graveyards for information, Hearify uses the **GFF Framework** to ensure every captured thought is actionable, contextualized, and retrievable.

## 💎 The GFF Framework: Our Core Philosophy

At the heart of Hearify is the **Trinity of Cognition**. We believe every human input can be distilled into three MECE (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive) categories:

| Category | Definition | The Role of JARVIS (AI) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **🎯 Goals** | Strategic intentions and future-states. | Drives accountability and suggests immediate "Next Steps." |
| **🎭 Feelings** | Qualitative sentiment and internal blockers. | Provides emotional awareness and identifies burnout patterns. |
| **📊 Facts** | Quantitative data and hard references. | Links raw data to existing entities (The "Amy Problem" solved). |

## 🌌 The Trinity Interface

We’ve replaced static tabs with a physics-based, 3D triptych designed for the natural flow of thought.

### 1. **Orbit (The Capture Loop)**

*The Conscious Entry Point.* A voice-first AI assistant (JARVIS-style) that doesn't just transcribe but **interrogates**.

* **Dynamic Interaction:** Interrupt the AI mid-sentence to pivot.
* **GFF Extraction:** AI automatically classifies inputs into Goals, Feelings, or Facts.

### 2. **Horizon (The Context Engine)**

*The Subconscious Map.* A 3D spatial canvas where your thoughts live as nodes.

* **Semantic Clustering:** Nodes move and cluster based on their GFF relationship.
* **Neural Lenses:** Toggle "Strategy Lens" to focus only on Goals, or "Reflection Lens" for Feelings.

### 3. **Chronicle (The Memory Archive)**

*The Narrative Record.* A high-fidelity bento-grid of your history.

* **Daily Deltas:** AI-generated executive summaries of your day's GFF shifts.
* **Entity Extraction:** Cross-links snippets via identified entities (People, Places, Concepts).

## 🚀 The Intelligence Layer

* **Hybrid Reasoning Path:** Dual-path processing utilizing **Groq (Fast Path)** for 100ms conversational banter and **DeepSeek R1 (Reasoning Path)** for deep structural insights.
* **Native Vector Search:** Industrial-grade `sqlite-vec` integration provides <5ms semantic retrieval across your entire life’s history.
* **Temporal Awareness:** The system is "Live Time" aware—it knows if your "Goal" is overdue or if your "Feelings" have been trending negative for three days.

> **My Vision:** *Hearify is where short-term dialogue meets long-term evolution. We don't just store what you think; we help you navigate how you grow.*
